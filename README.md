### Background
Many businesses nowadays embed recommendation systems in their web sites, in order to study the tastes of their customers, and achieve some business objectives. 
Harvesting aims to connect farmers and buyers from all over country to sell most of the crops from various farmers to buyers in optimal prices. The customers of HFN mandi are required to look into detailed description of all crops before buying as a result most of the time they are left with one or few choices in buying crops. So, the gap of not so good sales of crops can be filled by personalized recommendations to cope up with there decision-making sense and provide them with better services.

### Objective
The aim was to recommend crops to buyers based on their purchase history to increase sales.

### Given Data
Transaction data of Buyers: 
We generically refer to a transaction as a recorded interaction between a user and the Recommender System.
This data includes columns as Order, Buyer name, pin code, crop name, Qty, Crop Id and Date.

### Approach
**•	EDA:** Visualizing data and drawing insights          
**•	Model Building**: Popularity based Recommendations, Collaborative Filtering Models, Hybrid Engine         
**•	Algorithms:** Singular Value Decomposition, Pearson Similarity, Cosine Similarity         
**•	Evaluation:** RMSE, MAE scores
